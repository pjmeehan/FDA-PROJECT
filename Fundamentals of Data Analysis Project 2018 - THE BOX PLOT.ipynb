    "The box plot (also known as the box-and-whisker plot or the box-whisker plot) was created in 1970 by John Tukey, who many consider to be the father of exploratory data analysis.(1) Tukey was an exceptional man that lead a prodigious life. He was a chemist, topologist, educator, consultant, information scientist, researcher, statistician, data analyst and an executive. He attained both B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees at Brown University and M.A. and Ph.D. degrees at Princeton University. Tukey made a remarkable number of contributions to science, academia and industry and to his nation during a more than sixty year career. (A) An interesting fact about John Tukey is that he is credited with coining the terms *software* and *bit*. (2) He is also the brother in law of Francis Anscombe, who was the creator of the Anscombe quartet.(3). \n",
    "\n",
    "Tukey developed the box plot for several reasons, such as to broadly understand the data, to physically present data, to generate hypotheses and build models to guide research, to add robust measures to an analysis and to aid the researcher in finding the most appropriate method for analysis.(4) \n",
    "\n",
    "The boxplot is a \"Five Number Summary\" of a given data set and is a graphical visual based on five numbers (5). The five numbers are :\n",
    "1. the *minimum* -  the smallest  value value in the data set.\n",
    "2. the *first quartile (Q1)* - is the median of the lower half of the data set.\n",
    "3. the *median (Q2)* - is the median value of the whole data set.\n",
    "4. the *third quartile (Q3)* - is the median of the upper half of the data set.\n",
    "5. the *maximum* - is the largest value in the data set. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Some other box plot terms that should be mentioned are :\n",
    "\n",
    "*Interquartile Range (IQR)* - This is the area that lies inside the box (from Q1 to Q3).<br>\n",
    "*Outliers* - Are defined as being either lessor than 1.5 x IQR or greater than 1.5 x IQR. Outliers lie outside the range where we would expect them to lie. (5.55)\n",

    "In today's world, the box plot is mainly used as a way to visualize data distribution. A real world example of the use of box plots came from scientists who tracked the coral coverage of the Great Barrier Reef over a period of 27 years (1985 - 2012).(6) The box plot was extremly useful in this study because it gave a very understandable picture of the reef's health decline over the 27 years. Another example of the use of box plots in real life is in the paper \"Box plots and Radar Plots for Pharmaceutical Studies: Some of the Better Ways to get a clear Picture of Study Results\" by Mary Cowmeadow, Biostats Reports, Plymouth Michigan. (B). The paper is about finding a better way to to plot patient's lab results.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are just a couple of examples of how the box plot is used in today's world and there are far more industries such as manufacturing, medical, financial and academia that use box plots to aid them for everyday problems. Beverage bottling plants use box plots for quality control (D), the medical indusrty has used them to look at SIRD (severe idiopathic distress syndrome) in infants.(E) The financial indusrty uses box plots to compare performace amongst ETFs.

    "To demonstrate the use of a box plot, I will use the heights (measured in inches) and weights (measured in pounds) from the players of the New York Rangers, a team in the National Hockey League, from two different years to see if players are getting bigger.  The first dataset will be from the Rangers Stanley Cup winning season of 1994 and compare that to last season's (2018) team. I expect to see that height and weight will be greater for the 2018 team. 1994 was 24 years ago and since then the word has been that today's players are bigger. I'm not sure why, but if the box plots do indeed back this up, it would be worth exploring why they are bigger. Is it better training and nutrition? Or perhaps hockey is now available to more kids and thus the pool for NHL players is greater leading to more big players playing.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, this is just one team amongst 31 teams. A look across all players from 1994 vs 2018 would be a better dataset, however, I thought that a look at one team might provide some evidence of players getting bigger. Lets find out."

    "Thanks to the last box plot, I can confidently say that the 2018 team players are bigger than the 1994 players. However, that being said, the differences were not jaw dropping differences. The differences shown here should not make it seem that today's players are significantly bigger than those plyaers of 24 years ago. I'm not sure why it it constantly reiterated across the hockey media. Maybe HD tv causes players to look bigger, maybe the players are wearing bigger padding or maybe the training and nutrition are better today giving today's players better physiques.\n",
    "Agian, this was just a sample from one team to try to get an idea of the differences in today's players vs players from 24 years ago. My sample size needs to include all the players from 24 years ago compared to all the players of today in order to get a better idea. Or better yet, get a data set from players from 50 years ago and compare it to today's players.\n"

    "A violin plot plays a similar role as a box plot. It shows the distribution of quantitative data across several levels of one (or more) categorical variables such that those distributions can be compared. Unlike a box plot, in which all of the plot components correspond to actual datapoints, the violin plot features a kernel density estimation of the underlying distribution.This can be an effective and attractive way to show multiple distributions of data at once, but keep in mind that the estimation procedure is influenced by the sample size, and violins for relatively small samples might look misleadingly smooth.
