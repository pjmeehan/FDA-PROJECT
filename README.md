# FDA-PROJECT
Fundamentals of Data Analysis Project


The project is broken into 3 main parts :
1. The Box Plot -  this where a brief history of the box plot is given as well as definitions to key terms.

2. The demonstration - for the demonstration I subject matter that really interests me and that is sports especiall ice hockey.
For a few years now, the media has repeated the phrase "the players are bigger today than they were back then". I wanted to see if I coould back this up by looking at two sets of rosters, from 2 different years, from the New York Rangers, a team in the National Hockey Leaugue (NHL). I first compared their heights and then their weights. Finally, I compared their heights and weights based by position.
I did all the coparisons using box plots and then I summarized my findings.

3. Alternatives to Box Plots -  I provide 3 alternatives to the box plots with brief descriptions on each and how they compare/differ from box plots and give a plot example of each alternative using the height of all the players.

I used the pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn libraries to aid me.

In order to run the notebook, just start from cell 1 and keep clicking thr run button.
