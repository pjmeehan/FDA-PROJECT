    "The box plot (also known as the box-and-whisker plot or the box-whisker plot) was created in 1970 by John Tukey, who many consider to be the father of exploratory data analysis.(1) An interesting fact about John Tukey is that he is credited with coining the terms *software* and *bit*. (2) He is also the brother in law of Francis Anscombe, who was the creator of the Anscombe quartet.(3). Tukey developed the box plot for several reasons, such as to broadly understand the data, to physically present data, to generate hypotheses and build models to guide research, to add robust measures to an analysis and to aid the researcher in finding the most appropriate method for analysis.(4) \n",
    "\n",
    "The boxplot is a \"Five Number Summary\" of a given data set and is a graphical visual based on these five numbers (5). The five numbers are :\n",
    "1. the *minimum* -  the smallest  value value in the data set.\n",
    "2. the *first quartile* - is the median of the lower half of the data set.\n",
    "3. the *median* - is the median value of the whole data set.\n",
    "4. the *third quartile* - is the median of the upper half of the data set.\n",
    "5. the *maximum* - is the largest value in the data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "In today's world, the box plot is mainly used as a way to visualize data distribution. A real world example of the use of box plots came from scientists who tracked the coral coverage of the Great Barrier Reef over a period of 27 years (1985 - 2012).(6) The box plot was extremly useful in this study because it gave a very understandable picture of the reef's health decline over the 27 years."
