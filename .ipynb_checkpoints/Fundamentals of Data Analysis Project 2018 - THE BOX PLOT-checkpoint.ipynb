    "The box plot (also known as the box-and-whisker plot or the box-whisker plot) was created in 1970 by John Tukey, who many consider to be the father of exploratory data analysis.(1) Tukey was an exceptional man that lead a prodigious life. He was a chemist, topologist, educator, consultant, information scientist, researcher, statistician, data analyst and an executive. He attained both B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees at Brown University and M.A. and Ph.D. degrees at Princeton University. Tukey made aremarkable number of contributions to science, academia and industry and to his nation during a more than sixty year career. (A) An interesting fact about John Tukey is that he is credited with coining the terms *software* and *bit*. (2) He is also the brother in law of Francis Anscombe, who was the creator of the Anscombe quartet.(3). \n",
    "\n",
    "Tukey developed the box plot for several reasons, such as to broadly understand the data, to physically present data, to generate hypotheses and build models to guide research, to add robust measures to an analysis and to aid the researcher in finding the most appropriate method for analysis.(4) \n",
    "\n",
    "The boxplot is a \"Five Number Summary\" of a given data set and is a graphical visual based on five numbers (5). The five numbers are :\n",
    "1. the *minimum* -  the smallest  value value in the data set.\n",
    "2. the *first quartile (Q1)* - is the median of the lower half of the data set.\n",
    "3. the *median (Q2)* - is the median value of the whole data set.\n",
    "4. the *third quartile (Q3)* - is the median of the upper half of the data set.\n",
    "5. the *maximum* - is the largest value in the data set. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Some other box plot terms that should be mentioned are :\n",
    "\n",
    "*Interquartile Range (IQR)* - This is the area that lies inside the box (from Q1 to Q3).<br>\n",
    "*Outliers* - Are defined as being either lessor than 1.5 x IQR or greater than 1.5 x IQR. Outliers lie outside the range where we would expect them to lie. (5.55)\n",

    "In today's world, the box plot is mainly used as a way to visualize data distribution. A real world example of the use of box plots came from scientists who tracked the coral coverage of the Great Barrier Reef over a period of 27 years (1985 - 2012).(6) The box plot was extremly useful in this study because it gave a very understandable picture of the reef's health decline over the 27 years. Another example of the use of box plots in real life is in the paper \"Box plots and Radar Plots for Pharmaceutical Studies: Some of the Better Ways to get a clear Picture of Study Results\" by Mary Cowmeadow, Biostats Reports, Plymouth Michigan. (B). The paper is about finding a better way to to plot patient's lab results.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are just a couple of examples of how the box plot is used in today's world and there are far more industries such as manufacturing, medical, financial and academia that use box plots to aid them for everyday problems. Beverage bottling plants use box plots for quality control (D), the medical indusrty has used them to look at SIRD (severe idiopathic distress syndrome) in infants.(E) The financial indusrty uses box plots to compare performace amongst ETFs.
