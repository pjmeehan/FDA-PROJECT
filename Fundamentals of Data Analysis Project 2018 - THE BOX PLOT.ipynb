    "The boxplot (also known as box-and-whisker plots or box-whisker plots) was created in 1970 by John Tukey, who many consider to be the father of exploratory data analysis.(1) An interesting fact about John Tukey is that he is credited with coining the terms *software* and *bit*. (2) He is also the brother in law of Francis Anscombe, who was the creator of the Anscombe quartet.(3). Tukey developed the box plot to broadly understand the data, graphically represent data, generate hypotheses and build models to guide research, add robust measures to an analysis and aid the researcher in finding the most appropriate method for analysis.(4) The boxplot is a \"Five Number Summary\" of a given data set and is a graphical visual based on these five numbers. They are :\n",
    "1. the *minimum* -  the lowest value value in the dataset.\n",
    "2. the *first quartile* - \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "the first quartile, the median, the third quartile and the maximum."
